    <h1>Who is Flerky?</h1>
    <p>I adopt <b>flerky<b/> one year ago when i moved to my new home.
    <br/>This cat was living in <i>garden behind </i>outside to my house </p>
    <p> For six<span>months</span>, me and my boyfriend tried every day to get the cat to come to eat and to get him into the house.<br/>
        So one<strong>December 24</strong>  at night it was very cold outside, I went out and called the cat and gave him some food, and when the cat was eating I grabbed it and put it inside the house and we decided to adopt it.</p>
